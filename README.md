# Discord-bot-template
Template for creating discord bots in python

Requirements are listed in requirements.txt

To start the bot, create an "auth" file containing your discord authentication token for your bot (see ???LINK???).

To add a handler for messages - create a line in "handlers.py" that imports your handler, and a line that adds it to either message- or reaction handlers list
